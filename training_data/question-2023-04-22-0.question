[{"question:": "What is the main focus of the paper?", "answer": "The main focus of the paper is the architecture for autonomous navigation of tight multi-lane platoons traveling on public roads using connected and automated vehicles (CAVs)."}, {"question:": "What are the two main components of the proposed architecture?", "answer": "The two main components of the proposed architecture are an offline motion planner system and an online hierarchical control system."}, {"question:": "What optimization-based approach is used in the motion planner system?", "answer": "The motion planner system uses a constrained optimization scheme for cooperative formation and reconfiguration in tight spaces to plan smooth, dynamically feasible, and collision-free trajectories for all the vehicles within the platoon."}, {"question:": "What are the three levels of the online hierarchical control system?", "answer": "The three levels of the online hierarchical control system are a traffic operation system (TOS), a decision-maker, and a path-follower."}]
