A random number of frames were skipped by repeatedly taking the null or do nothing action before giving control to the agent in order to ensure variation in the initial conditions. The agents were allowed to play until the end of the game or up to 18000 frames (5 minutes), whichever came first, and the scores were averaged over all 30 episodes."}, {"question:": "What is the purpose of the 'human starts' evaluation method?", "answer": "The 'human starts' evaluation method aims to measure how well the agent generalizes to states it may not have trained on. To that end, 100 random starting points were introduced that were sampled from a human professional\u2019s gameplay for each game. To evaluate an agent, it was run from each of the 100 starting points until the end of the game or until a total of 108000 frames (equivalent to 30 minutes) were played counting the frames the human played to reach the starting point. The total score accumulated only by the agent (not considering any points won by the human player) were averaged to obtain the evaluation score."}, {"question:": "How did Gorila DQN perform compared to single GPU DQN agents in the evaluation using human starts?", "answer": "Using human starts, Gorila DQN outperformed single GPU DQN on 41 out of 49 games given roughly one half of the training time of single GPU DQN.

collision-free paths for agents from their start to their goal locations that minimize the makespan."}, {"question:": "What is the objective of developing a MAPF solver that combines the advantages of MAPF solvers from AI and robotics?", "answer": "The objective of developing a MAPF solver that combines the advantages of MAPF solvers from AI and robotics is to create a solver that can handle agents with kinematic constraints in cluttered and tight environments while still solving MAPF problems for hundreds of agents in a reasonable amount of time."}, {"question:": "What is MAPF-POST?", "answer": "MAPF-POST is a novel approach that makes use of a simple temporal network to postprocess a MAPF plan in polynomial time to create a plan-execution schedule that works on non-holonomic robots, takes their maximum translational and rotational velocities into account, provides a guaranteed safety distance between them, and exploits slack to absorb imperfect plan executions and avoid time-intensive replanning in many cases."}, {"question:": "What are some applications of solving the MAPF problem?", "answer": "Some applications of solving the MAPF problem include improving traffic at

problem of finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a given environment."}, {"question": "What is the goal of the MAPF problem?", "answer": "The goal of the MAPF problem is to find collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start to their goal vertices that minimize the makespan."}, {"question": "What is the optimal MAPF plan for the running example?", "answer": "The optimal MAPF plan for the running example is shown in Figure 1c, which consists of collision-free paths for all agents and has a makespan of four."}, {"question": "Is it possible to execute the MAPF plan safely on actual robots?", "answer": "It is nearly impossible to execute the MAPF plan safely on actual robots due to their imperfect plan-execution capabilities, such as non-uniform edge lengths or velocity limits, kinematic constraints, slip, and other robot and environmental limitations."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of the Temporal Plan Graph (TPG)?", "answer": "The Temporal Plan Graph (TPG) provides a partial order among the events of a MAPF plan, which allows for flexibility to take into account both maximum velocities and imperfect plan-execution capabilities of actual robots."}, {"question": "How is the TPG constructed for a given MAPF plan?", "answer": "The TPG is constructed for a given MAPF plan by extracting a route for each agent, creating location vertices for each location on the route, and creating Type 1 edges to enforce the order in which an agent enters locations on its path and Type 2 edges to enforce the order in which different agents enter the same location."}, {"question": "What are safety markers in the TPG?", "answer": "Safety markers are additional vertices added to the TPG to provide a guaranteed safety distance between agents.
