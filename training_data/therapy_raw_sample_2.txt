Patient: Hi, I'm really glad we're having this session today.

Therapist: Hi there! What brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. My job has been really stressful and I just can't seem to keep up with everything. It's starting to affect my personal life too.

Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, my workload has just been piling up and I feel like I can't get anything done. I'm constantly stressed and anxious, and I'm not sleeping well.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Have you tried any strategies to help manage your stress?

Patient: I've tried some breathing exercises and meditation, but they don't seem to be helping much. I just feel like I can't escape the stress.

Therapist: It's great that you've been trying some coping strategies. Sometimes it takes a bit of trial and error to find what works best for you. Have you considered talking to your employer about your workload?

Patient: I have, but I'm worried that they'll think I can't handle the job. I don't want to seem weak or incapable.

Therapist: I understand that concern, but it's important to prioritize your mental health. You are not weak for needing support. It's okay to ask for help. Have you heard of interpersonal therapy?

Patient: No, I haven't. What is it?

Therapist: Interpersonal therapy is a type of therapy that focuses on improving your relationships with others. It can help you understand how your relationships are affecting your mental health and teach you strategies for improving those relationships.

Patient: That sounds like it could be helpful. I've been feeling really isolated lately, and I think it's been contributing to my stress.

Therapist: Definitely. Isolation can be a contributing factor to stress and anxiety. In interpersonal therapy, we would work to identify any patterns or issues in your relationships and develop strategies for improving them. It can be a really effective way to reduce stress and improve overall mental health.

Patient: That sounds like it could be really helpful for me. How long does the therapy usually take?

Therapist: It varies for each person, but typically interpersonal therapy lasts for around 12-16 weeks. It's a relatively short-term therapy, but it can have long-lasting benefits.

Patient: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. How often would we meet?

Therapist: Usually once a week for about an hour. We would work together to set goals for each session and track your progress over time.

Patient: Okay, that sounds doable. I think I would like to try that.

Therapist: Great! I'm glad you're interested. I think it could be really beneficial for you. Let's work on setting up a plan for starting interpersonal therapy.

Patient: Thank you so much for your help. I'm really looking forward to getting started.

Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you and help you achieve your goals. We'll work together to get you on a path towards improved mental health.
